# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Using-CNN
An image processing model which detects and predicts breast cancer using CNN.
A classification system for breast cancer, which is trained on MRI images some of which are normal and others are cancerous. The cancerous images are further divided into two categories: benign and malignant. 
The model makes use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to be able to make the desired classification on the MRI images. The classifier will then proceed to classify it as normal or cancerous. If it is cancerous, then it will be further divided into benign or malignant.
